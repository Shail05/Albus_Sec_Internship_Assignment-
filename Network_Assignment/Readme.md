Introduction

This README file provides detailed instructions and explanations for the networking assignment. The assignment involves configuring network switches, implementing VLAN trunking, assigning IP addresses and subnets, and understanding various networking protocols such as TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, and HTTP.

Objective

The objective of this assignment is to demonstrate practical knowledge in setting up and managing network infrastructure. By the end of this assignment, students should be able to:

Configure network switches.
Implement VLAN trunking.
Design and assign IP addresses and subnets.
Understand and explain the functions of key networking protocols.

IP Addressing and Subnetting

IP addressing and subnetting are crucial for network organization and management.Assign IP addresses to devices within each subnet.

Networking Protocols

TCP/IP
The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite is the foundation of modern networking.
DNS
The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses.
DHCP
The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) automatically assigns IP addresses to devices.
HTTP
The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of data communication on the web.

Conclusion
This assignment provides a comprehensive understanding of fundamental networking concepts and configurations. By following the instructions, students will gain hands-on experience in setting up and managing network infrastructure.

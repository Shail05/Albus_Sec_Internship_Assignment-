Web Security Assignment

Overview

This assignment focuses on enhancing web security through the creation of two essential tools:

Password Manager Tool

Network Security Scanner Tool

Each tool addresses a specific aspect of web security, providing users with powerful features to protect and manage their digital assets. Developing these tools not only strengthened my understanding of web security principles but also significantly improved my Python coding skills through hands-on practice and problem-solving.

Tools Description
1. Password Manager Tool

The Password Manager Tool is designed to securely store and retrieve passwords. It includes the following features:

Secure Storage and Retrieval: Allows users to securely store and retrieve their passwords.

Password Generation: Generates strong, random passwords to enhance security.

Encryption: Encrypts stored passwords to protect them from unauthorized access.

Code Structure

pass_manager(main).py: Main script for storing and retrieving passwords.

pass_manager.py: Script for storing and retrieving passwords.

password_generator.py: Script for generating strong passwords.

encod_decod.py: Script for encrypting and decrypting passwords.

2. Network Security Scanner Tool

The Network Security Scanner Tool consists of multiple components aimed at scanning networks and identifying potential security vulnerabilities. It includes the following features:

IP Address Identifier: Provides the IPv4 address of a domain name.

Port Scanning: Scans specified ports on a target IP to check for open ports.

Network Traffic Analysis: Provides insights into network traffic patterns, protocols, and potential security vulnerabilities.

Code Structure

ip_add.py: Script for identifying the IPv4 address of a domain name.

port_scanner.py: Script for scanning open ports on a target IP.

net_scan.py: Main script for analyzing network traffic and identifying security vulnerabilities.

Installation

To install and set up the tools, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Shail05/Albus_Sec_Internship_Assignment-/tree/main/WebSec_Assignment

How This Assignment Improved My Python Skills

Working on this assignment has significantly improved my Python coding skills in several ways:

Problem-Solving: Tackling real-world security issues and developing practical solutions enhanced my ability to think critically and solve complex problems.

Code Structure: Organizing the code into separate modules for each functionality taught me the importance of clean, modular code.

Security Best Practices: Implementing encryption and secure storage methods deepened my understanding of security best practices in software development.

Network Programming: Developing the Network Security Scanner Tool provided hands-on experience with network programming and understanding network protocols.

Conclusion

This Web Security Assignment was a valuable experience that enhanced my web security knowledge and significantly improved my Python programming skills. The development of the Password Manager Tool and the Network Security Scanner Tool equipped me with practical skills and a deeper understanding of cybersecurity concepts.

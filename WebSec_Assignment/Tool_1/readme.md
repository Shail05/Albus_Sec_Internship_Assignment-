**Password Manager Tool**

## Overview
The Password Manager Tool is a secure and efficient application designed to help users manage their passwords. The tool offers functionality for generating, encrypting, storing, and retrieving passwords. It ensures the security by employing advanced cryptographic techniques.

## File Descriptions

1. `encod_decod.py`
This file contains functions for encoding and decoding passwords using Base64 and the Fernet symmetric encryption standard. It leverages the `base64` and `cryptography.fernet` libraries to provide secure password handling.

2. `password_generator.py`
This file includes functions for generating secure, random passwords. It utilizes the `secrets` library for cryptographic random number generation and the `string` library for assembling the passwords.

3. `pass_manager.py`
This file handles the core functionality of the password manager. It includes functions for adding new passwords, retrieving existing ones, and securely storing them in a file. The file makes use of the `hashlib`, `os`, and `getpass` libraries for secure password handling and file operations.

4. `pass_manager(main).py`
This is the main script that integrates all functionalities from the other files. It presents a user-friendly interface, allowing users to generate new passwords, encrypt them, add them to the password manager, and retrieve them when needed. It leverages all the libraries mentioned below to provide a cohesive user experience.

## Libraries Used

 `hashlib`: Provides a common interface to many secure hash and message digest algorithms.
 `getpass`: Facilitates secure handling of passwords and other sensitive input.
 `os`: Provides a way of using operating system-dependent functionality like reading or writing to the file system.
 `base64`: Provides functions for encoding binary data to Base64 and decoding Base64 back to binary data.
 `secrets`: Provides functions for generating secure random numbers suitable for cryptographic use.
 `string`: Contains a collection of string constants and utility functions.
 `cryptography.fernet`: Implements the Fernet symmetric encryption standard.
 `cryptography.hazmat.primitives.hashes`: Provides a variety of cryptographic hash functions.
 `cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.pbkdf2`: Implements the PBKDF2 key derivation function.

## Working of Main Code

The `pass_manager(main).py` script is the entry point of the application. It interprets the user's choices and executes the corresponding functions. The workflow is as follows:

1. **User Interaction**: The script starts by presenting options to the user, asking them to input their requirements.
2. **Password Generation**: Users can generate a password using the secure random generation functions. The generated password is then encrypted using SHA256 hash.
3. **Adding Passwords**: Users can add new passwords to the manager. These passwords are securely stored in a separate file using file handling techniques.
4. **Retrieving Passwords**: Users can retrieve stored passwords. The tool ensures that all retrieved passwords are handled securely.

The Password Manager Tool provides significant benefits, including secure encryption of passwords, easy retrieval, and safe storage. Users can rely on the tool for managing their passwords efficiently and securely.

## Conclusion

The Password Manager Tool is a comprehensive solution for password management. With its robust encryption and secure handling capabilities, users can confidently manage their passwords. The tool's modular design and use of advanced cryptographic libraries ensure that all sensitive information is protected against unauthorized access.

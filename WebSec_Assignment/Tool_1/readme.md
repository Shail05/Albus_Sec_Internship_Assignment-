**Password Manager Tool**

The Password Manager Tool is designed to securely store and retrieve passwords. It includes the following features:

Secure Storage and Retrieval: Allows users to securely store and retrieve their passwords.

Password Generation: Generates strong, random passwords to enhance security.

Encryption: Encrypts stored passwords to protect them from unauthorized access.


Code Structure

pass_manager(main).py: Main script for storing and retrieving passwords.

pass_manager.py: Script for managing generated passwords.

password_generator.py: Script for generating strong passwords.

encod_decod.py: Script for encrypting and decrypting passwords.


Libraries Used:

1. hashlib: Provides a common interface to many secure hash and message digest algorithms.
2. getpass: Facilitates secure handling of passwords and other sensitive input.
3. os: Provides a way of using operating system-dependent functionality like reading or writing to the file system.
4. getpass: Facilitates secure handling of passwords and other sensitive input (repeated).
5. base64: Provides functions for encoding binary data to Base64 and decoding Base64 back to binary data.
6. secrets: Provides functions for generating secure random numbers suitable for cryptographic use.
7. string: Contains a collection of string constants and utility functions.
8. cryptography.fernet: Implements the Fernet symmetric encryption standard.
9. cryptography.hazmat.primitives.hashes: Provides a variety of cryptographic hash functions.
10. cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.pbkdf2: Implements the PBKDF2 key derivation function.

Working of Main Code:

Different functions are created to perform different operations.  Interpreting the code and beginning with choices asking user to give input according to their requirement. User can generate password and code will generate encrypted password in SHA256 hash. Moreover, operations like get password and add password are provided with advantage of saving the added passwords in separate file using file handling. Password Generating code provide benefits to users as it provide encrypted passwords, can even use and save them for future.
